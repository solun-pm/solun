## What is the purpose of Solun?

Solun aims to fill the gap in the privacy space and create an independent, open service that allows you to share files, text and send emails with end-to-end encryption - without having to use external services like
Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal and more.

## Developing locally

### NPM
