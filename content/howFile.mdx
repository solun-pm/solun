## **Secure File Storage**

At Solun, we employ advanced **cryptographic algorithms** to ensure your files are stored securely. Here's a simplified glimpse into our process, designed for everyone to understand:

### **Encryption:**
When your files are stored, they're encrypted using an advanced technique known as '**aes-256-cbc**'.
This method utilizes a unique '**key**' to convert your data into an unreadable format. We generate this key using a secure process and a random set of data, called an '**Initialization Vector (IV)**', to ensure each encryption is unique.

### **Storage:**
Once encrypted, your files are safely stored on **government-certified Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs)**.
These drives are built to automatically encrypt all stored data, further enhancing security.

### **Decryption:**
When you need to access your stored files, we use the original '**key**' and '**IV**' to decrypt them. This process transforms the encrypted data back into its original, readable format.

### **Secure Deletion:**
After a certain period, or when the data is no longer needed, we securely delete it from our drives. This deletion process is thorough and **irreversible**, ensuring old data can't be recovered.

Whether you're sharing encrypted notes or uploading sensitive files, you can be confident that Solun provides robust security at every step.
By combining cutting-edge encryption methods with secure storage and deletion practices, Solun offers a comprehensive solution for your data privacy needs.
