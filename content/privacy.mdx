### Privacy Policy
#### Last modified: 2023-05-16

We at Solun are commited to protecting your privacy, we're taking all the necessary steps to ensure that your data is safe and secure.

### 1. **Service description**
Solun is a free web based service that allows users to create encrypted notes, upload files which get encrypted and creating a free mailbox.
Users can share encrypted messages, and files over the internet as unique one-time-use HTTPS URLs which by default expire after its first access or download via any web browser.

The sending of the link is the full responsibility of the user, Solun does not store any information about the sender or the receiver of the link.
Depending on the communication plattform used to send the link, there may be a certain risk that third parties intercept your communication.

#### 2. **How the notes and files are encrypted**
The link is generated in the Solun backend, depending on the options selected by the user, the link can be not recoverable by Solun, or someone else without the link.
With the Default Options, the Secret Key will get stored in Solun's database, this is for people who want to have a quick share link which is encrypted.
We use the secret key which is generated by a Cryptographically HEX Random Generator, and the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm to encrypt the note or file.

A note or file gets deleted after someone access the note, or download the file, or after the expiration date is reached.

After a note, or a file is deleted from Solun, there is absolutely no way to recover it, even Solun will not be able to recover it.

The Solun Team will do as much as possible to protect your data, but even if someone or something gets access to our servers, they will not be able to decrypt any note or file if you enabled the "End-To-End-Encryption" option.

#### 3. **How the mailbox works**
The mailbox is a free service provided by Solun, it allows users to create a free mailbox with a custom domain name.
We encrypt all the emails that are sent to your mailbox and mails that are sent from your mailbox with the same encryption algorithm used for the notes and files - one change is that we use your password as secret-key, we hash your password with multiple Salt Hashing Algorithms so that we can't see your password, ever.
You can also use the Solun mailbox with your own PGP key, this will allow you to send and receive really secure emails, Solun will not be able to see your emails.

#### 4. **Processing of IP addresses**
Solun is not logging any IP addresses, they are processed to enable communication with the Solun servers, but they are not a part of the log files.
IP addresses are not stored in the database, and they are not used for any other purpose than to enable communication with the Solun servers.
